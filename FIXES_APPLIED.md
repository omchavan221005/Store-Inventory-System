# Fixes Applied to Store Inventory System

## Date: 2025-10-01

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Student Addition Not Working ✅
**Problem:** Students were not being added to the database when submitting the form.

**Root Cause:** The HTML form used field names (`fullName`, `rollNumber`, `department`) that didn't match the WTForms field names expected by the Flask route.

**Solution:**
- Modified `/add_student` route in `app.py` to accept form data directly from `request.form`
- Added proper validation for required fields
- Added duplicate roll number checking
- Added better error messages with flash notifications
- Form now works with both WTForms and regular HTML forms

**Files Modified:**
- `app.py` - Lines 398-438

### 2. Student-Product Assignments Not Showing on Dashboard ✅
**Problem:** The dashboard didn't show which students had which products assigned.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced the "Recent Assignments" table to show:
  - Student name and roll number
  - Product name and category
  - Assignment date and time
  - Active/Returned status
- Added new "Student Product Assignments" section showing:
  - Complete list of active assignments
  - Student details (name, roll number, department)
  - Assigned product details
  - Assignment dates
  - Active status badges

**Files Modified:**
- `templates/dashboard.html` - Added new section (lines 230-303)
- Enhanced existing assignment display (lines 137-161)

### 3. Product Assignment Modal Not Working ✅
**Problem:** Assigning products to students from the modal wasn't working properly.

**Solution:**
- Updated `/assign_product/<student_id>` route to handle both JSON and form submissions
- Added proper error handling with flash messages
- Added redirect responses for form submissions
- Modal now properly submits and shows success/error messages

**Files Modified:**
- `app.py` - Lines 440-537
- `templates/student_details.html` - Added flash message display

### 4. Student Product Display Issues ✅
**Problem:** Student table wasn't showing assigned products correctly.

**Solution:**
- Fixed the relationship reference from `student.product` to `student.current_product`
- Added proper null checking
- Display now shows:
  - Product name
  - Product category
  - Available quantity
  - "No Product Assigned" message when appropriate

**Files Modified:**
- `templates/student_details.html` - Lines 451-458

## New Features Added

### 1. Enhanced Dashboard
- **Student Product Assignments Section:** New dedicated section showing all active assignments

### 2. Better Error Handling
